          Your driver code will be activated as soon as a payment of $40.00 is processed. Important! Your monthly
          membership fee will be automatically debited from your debit or credit card on the same day each month. The
          day will be the day you activated your driver code. Example! If you activated your driver code on June 4th,
          then you’ll be debited on the 4th of every month. Please follow the steps below to get started.

          safe ride is only a booking app and they aren’t responsible in any way for helping to find drivers
          passengers. I understand it’s my own responsibility as an independent contractor when using this app to find
          my own passengers by networking while driving for other rideshare companies and giving out my driver code to
          all potential passengers.
