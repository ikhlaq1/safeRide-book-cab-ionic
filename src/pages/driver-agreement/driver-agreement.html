          only an online booking platform and they aren’t responsible
          in any way for helping to find drivers passengers. I understand it’s my own responsibility as an
          independent contractor when using this platform to find my own passengers by networking while driving for
          other rideshare companies and giving out my driver code to all potential passengers.

          and/or Venmo directly from the passenger at the time of drop-off. It’s also my responsibility to cancel
          any rides I can't service.
